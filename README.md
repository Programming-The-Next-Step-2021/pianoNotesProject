# pianoNotesProject

This project is aimed at teaching people how to read the notes of all 88 piano keys. As learning how to see and play piano notes is one of the first steps in becoming a good piano player, this program will hopefully facilitate this.
One will be presented with a picture of a note and then has to press the corresponding key on they keyboard or - if time allows for an implementation - the key on a digital piano that is connected via MIDI. Then the tone will be played and one will receive feedback of whether it was the correct key or not.

If time allows for this, it will be expanded to a simple flashcard-type system following the [SM-2 algorithm](https://github.com/alankan886/SuperMemo2) that allows the user to train the difficult notes more often and facilitate long term memory.
